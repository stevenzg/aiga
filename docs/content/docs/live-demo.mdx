description: See Aiga in action — real cross-framework sub-apps running in adaptive sandboxes.
---

This is a live demo running the actual Aiga framework. Two independently deployed applications — one built with **React**, the other with **Svelte** — are embedded side by side using `<aiga-app>` with `sandbox="strict"`.

Each sub-app runs in a **pooled iframe** with full JS/CSS isolation, storage namespacing, and automatic resize handling. The iframes are acquired from Aiga's pre-warmed pool for near-instant startup.

<LiveDemo />

## What's Happening

1. `initAiga()` creates a singleton instance, registers `<aiga-app>` custom elements, and pre-warms the iframe pool
2. Each `<aiga-app>` element acquires an iframe from the pool (~0ms vs 50-100ms cold start)
3. The sub-app URL is loaded inside the pooled iframe with the bridge script injected
4. Storage (localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies) is automatically namespaced per app
5. CSS variables from the host are synced into each iframe via postMessage
6. ResizeObserver tracks content height and auto-resizes the iframe

## Try It Locally

To run the full example with Vite dev server:

```bash
# From the repository root
cd examples/basic
npm run dev
```

This starts a Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173` with hot-reload and source maps for the Aiga library.
