title: Shared Todos
description: React todo manager syncs with a Svelte list display via RPC.
---

Add, check, and remove todos in the React app — the Svelte app renders a synced list with progress stats.

```
React Todos ──todos-change──▷ Host ──todos-update──▷ Svelte List
```

<TodosDemo />

## How It Works

1. The React app manages a full todo list with add, toggle complete, and delete
2. On every change, it sends the entire todo array via `rpcEmit('todos-change', { todos })`
3. The Svelte list receives `todos-update` and renders items with a progress bar showing completion stats
4. State lives in the React app; the Svelte app is a pure display consumer
