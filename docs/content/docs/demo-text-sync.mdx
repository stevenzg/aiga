title: Text Sync
description: React editor sends text to Svelte preview in real-time via RPC.
---

Type in the React editor on the left — the text appears in the Svelte preview on the right in real-time. The host page relays RPC events between the two sandboxed apps:

```
React Editor ──content-change──▷ Host ──content-update──▷ Svelte Preview
```

<TextSyncDemo />

## How It Works

1. Both apps run in `sandbox="strict"` iframes from the pool
2. The React editor calls `rpcEmit('content-change', text)` on every keystroke
3. The host listens on the left app's RPC channel and forwards to the right app
4. The Svelte preview listens for `content-update` events and renders the text

```ts
// Host relay
const leftRpc = reactEditor.rpcChannel;
const rightRpc = sveltePreview.rpcChannel;

leftRpc.on('content-change', (data) => {
  rightRpc.emit('content-update', data);
});
```
