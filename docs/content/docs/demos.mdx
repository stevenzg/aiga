Explore Aiga's key features through interactive demos. Each demo simulates real framework behavior to help you understand the architecture.

## Sandbox Tier Explorer

Switch between the 4 isolation tiers to compare their features, overhead, and usage patterns. The capability matrix shows exactly what each tier provides.

## RPC Channel Simulator

Simulate typed RPC calls between a host application and a sub-app. Try calling methods, observe the message flow, and see what happens on timeout.

## Router Playground

Enter URL paths and see how the router matches them against route configurations. Test dynamic parameters, nested routes, and 404 handling in both history and hash modes.

## Overlay Handling Demo

See how overlays work differently in Light (teleportation) and Strict (iframe promotion) modes. Toggle overlays to observe the detection and rendering flow.
