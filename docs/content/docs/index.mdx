description: Aiga — Next-generation micro-frontend framework with adaptive sandbox architecture.
---

**Aiga** is a micro-frontend framework that lets you embed independent web applications into a host page with adaptive isolation levels, typed cross-app communication, and automatic overlay handling — all through a single `<mf-app>` Web Component.

## Key Ideas

1. **Adaptive Sandbox Architecture** — 4 isolation tiers (`none`, `light`, `strict`, `remote`) so you choose the right trade-off per sub-app.
2. **`<mf-app>` Web Component** — Works in React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or vanilla HTML.
3. **Pre-warmed iframe Pool** — Near-instant (~0ms) iframe acquisition with LRU eviction.
4. **Typed RPC Channel** — Promise-based `postMessage` with timeout handling and type safety.
5. **Overlay Teleportation** — Modals and popovers escape Shadow DOM and iframe boundaries automatically.
6. **Built-in Router** — URL-based routing with nested routes, dynamic params, guards, and `<mf-router-view>`.

## Quick Start

```html
<script type="module">
  import { initAiga } from 'aiga';
  initAiga();
</script>

<!-- That's it. Now use it anywhere: -->
<mf-app src="https://dashboard.app/" sandbox="strict" keep-alive />
<mf-app src="https://settings.app/" sandbox="light" />
<mf-app src="https://widget.cdn.com/" sandbox="remote" />
```

## Architecture at a Glance

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<mf-app>` | Unified entry point — load, mount, unmount sub-apps |
| Sandbox Adapters | 4 implementations: None, Light, Strict, Remote |
| iframe Pool | Pre-warmed pool with LRU + keep-alive manager |
| RPC Channel | Typed request/response over postMessage |
| Overlay Layer | Teleport or promote overlays for correct rendering |
| Router | URL-based routing with `<mf-router-view>` |
| Service Worker | Cross-iframe resource caching |
